# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
Briefly describe any errors, bugs, or confusion you encountered and how you solved it.
- I had a couple minor incidents causing minor confusion.  The first was when I created a 2nd profile, and was trying to copy/paste the supplied text in without looking at or modifying the App.jsx file so it referenced the 2nd profile only--I tried to reference both simultaneously, and it was not handling it as expected.  So I created a parallel file with UserProfile2.jsx, and then I was able to modify the App.jsx ever-so-slightly, and see the immediate change in the browser--which was very satisfying.  The other confusion was I made the mistake of auto-adding a README at the moment of creating the repository--this is has been something I've generally done automatically since assignment 3A, I think.  But git did not like this fork situation and I am insufficiently clever within git to finesse it--so I removed it, still had trouble, and finally figured out that I can force a push.  This seemed to do the trick.  Almost everything else went very smoothly.
